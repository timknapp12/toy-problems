// What do you do when you see a JS toy problem?
// 1- clarify what is being asked.
// 2- look at or ask for sample data/ sample results.
// 3- pseudo code- code broken down into regular English - list out the tools or methods that youâ€™ll use.
// 4- code
// 5- come up with another solution

// PROBLEM #1

// Create a function to filter over the array called numbers and return a new array with only the even numbers. Make sure to use the arrow function combined with the filter method.
// * Should use arrow function
// * Should use filter method

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

var evens = () => numbers.filter(e => e % 2 === 0);
